          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <body>My client wanted to break into the cloud storage space with a clear idea of what kind of features they wanted their service to provide, but not much else. They needed a name, a brand, and a designer platform that could achieve their goals and offer a unique alternative to the existing cloud services. I was tasked with creating a design that would fulfill their functional demands and create a compelling brand to build a business on.
            </body>
          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <body>The solution I designed was rooted in research. Survey data showed existing cloud storage users’ main complaints about their chosen platforms were they wanted more free space, and their ‘clouds’ were difficult to organize. Using survey data, I developed a set of user stories that designated the key features of the new service: allow users to organize their data, keep it free or cheap, allow users to share, and offer content creation tools. These limited, key functions influenced the rest of my design choices and led to a minimal, Brutalism-inspired interface that I believe will differentiate my client’s cloud storage service from existing competitors, and address their users’ frustrations.

        <section "Survey">
          <h2>Survey</h2>
          <body> As a general picture, backing up files for free is the main reason why people use cloud storage, with content creation being a strong second. A deliberate focus on sharing may be unnecessary, as most people value the ability to share content, but do it less frequently. With this information in mind, I saw the client having two options: stick to the basics of offering cheap storage, and improve on usability; or investigate the Adobe model for cloud storage, and license out superior content creation tools for users. Since either direction would benefit from a simple, strong design scheme, I left this eventual decision up to my client and proceeded to gather more information to design from.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <body>Now that I had useful survey data to contextualize the cloud storage space, I decided to look at what existing cloud companies were doing with their platforms. I chose three popular cloud storage providers to perform a competitive analysis on: Box, Google Drive, and Dropbox. The experience of looking at these services simultaneously was informative but boring. In the end, I had three main insights

        <section "Personas">
          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <body>These user types were created from the larger trends of my survey results. The primary features that people reported wanting were the abilities to save/backup personal files, create content, and to a lesser extent, save internet content. Consequently, I made three personas based on these key features. Fleshing out these personas into believable characters made it easier to remember who I wanted to design this service for, and how common users would be interacting with it.

        <section "User Stories">
          <h2>User Stories</h2>
          <body>Now that I knew who to design for, I could better plan what kind of actions these user types would be most interested in. Creating a series of user stories was an important step when considering information hierarchy and general information architecture for the service. After listing their likely desired actions, I ranked their values from low to high priority. From these lists, I was able to derive a minimal viable product that I knew I would at least need to create to satisfy both the potential users and the client.

        <section "User Flows">
          <h2>User Flows</h2>
          <body>I already knew based on the simple requests of potential users seen in the survey data, and their wishes for increased organization, my designs would benefit from staying minimal. I knew that a central dashboard was a common and successful design choice among other cloud services, and so thought that a user’s choices should likely radiate out from one. After a login process, users would be dropped into a dashboard that would allow them to pursue their likely actions from a single location. I was not sure what that might look like at this point, but I was beginning to get ideas for my next step.
